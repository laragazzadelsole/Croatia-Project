      "survey_description": "This research study aims to investigate the effectiveness of matching firms with scientists by rigorously evaluating this support for firms in Croatia under the SCINERGY '24 Pilot.\nThe pilot is designed to introduce scientists who have relevant expertise to firms and assist their discussions.\n\nMatchmakers coordinate the meetings, helping to overcome challenges, and providing professional support through intensive handholding and knowledge transfer on key questions related to IP regulations, partnership agreements, and certification processes, amongst others. The matched pairs of scientists and business work jointly on concrete projects during the matchmaking phase.\n\nBy comparing randomly selected pilot firms and non-selected comparison firms, we seek to establish causal relationships between matchmaking support and its corresponding outcomes, while also distinguishing the effects for various types of firms.\n\nThe following questions regard your beliefs on the likely impact of BEING OFFERED the full pilot, regardless of whether or not a firm decides to participate in it. It is simply the mean difference of the outcomes for the firms that get offered the assistance, compared to similar firms that do not."
