      "survey_title": "Matching Firms and Scientists: Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial in Croatia",
      "survey_description": "This research study aims to investigate the effectiveness of matching support for firms and scientists by rigorously evaluating this support for firms in Croatia.\nThe pilot is designed to introduce eligible firms with scientists who have relevant expertise.\n\nMatchmakers coordinate the meetings, helping to overcome challenges, and providing professional support through intensive handholding and knowledge transfer on key questions related to IP regulations, partnership agreements, and certification processes, amongst others. The matched pairs of scientists and business work jointly on concrete projects during the matchmaking phase.\n\nBy comparing randomly selected pilot firms and non-selected comparison firms, we seek to establish causal relationships between matchmaking support and its corresponding outcomes, while also distinguishing the effects for various types of firms.\n\nNon-financial support will be provided to eligible SMEs for which scientific support can be provided. The focus is on facilitating connections between the scientific and business communities through workshops, enabling firms to explore scientific trends, collaborate with scientists, test new products, and seek legal advice and financing options.\n\nThe following 14 questions regard your beliefs on, what is called in technical terms, the intention-to-treat effect (ITT). It is the effect of BEING OFFERED the full pilot, regardless of whether or not a firm decides to participate. It is simply the mean difference of the outcomes for the firms that get the assistance, compared to the firms that do not. In other words, you will be asked what you think it is the likely impact of the pilot for the firms that are offered the intervention, compared to those that do not participate to the pilot."
