This means that for every euro spent, the program delivers one and a half euro in benefits. A higher ratio indicates greater efficiency and value for money. This question prompts to consider the efficiency and economic justification for scaling a program, ensuring that the decision aligns with both fiscal responsibility and the desired impact.  \nAt what cost-benefit ratio would you consider scaling a program?  \nConsider “benefits” that occurred after 2 years of running the program and “costs” as the total expenses incurred to implement, operate, and maintain a program or project (including administration and overhead costs).")
